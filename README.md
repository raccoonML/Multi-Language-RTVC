## Project History

This project was started in 2021 with the goal of inheriting Corentin Jemine's [``Real-Time-Voice-Cloning``](https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning).
The project originated from the wish of multi-language support for voice cloning models and is now
maintained and enhanced by contributing volunteers.
