# ``MLRTVC`` Code of Conduct

We are a community based on an open-mindness and a common belief
in the purpose of this project, always putting technical and
scientific topics over personal ones.

Discussions are led using a friendly and respectful tone,
prioritizing didactic, exploratory thinking, leading to
decisions being made based on technical merit, consensus
and complexity.

We treat people equally, regardless of their background or
personal characteristics.

Contributions are welcome, not only in the form of code.
You can take part in GitHub discussions, review PRs, answer
questions, write documentation, enhance the Wiki pages,
work on issues or help make ``MLRTVC`` more popular.

We abide by the principles of openness, respect, and consideration
of others of the Python Software Foundation: https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/

This Code of Conduct is in parts adapted and inspired from
[``scikit-learn``](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn)'s Code of conduct: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
